    "- You **MAY** use AI tools to help with this assignment\n",
    "- You **MUST** understand and be able to explain all code you submit\n",
    "- All visualizations must be publication-quality (proper titles, labels, legends)\n",
    "- Document any AI usage in the reflection section at the end\n",
