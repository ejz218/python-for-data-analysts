You will create various chart types, customize their appearance, and practice choosing appropriate visualizations for different questions — all using the **extended Lehigh student dataset** (600 students, 15 variables).\n\n**Rules:**\n- You **MAY** use AI tools to help with this assignment\n- You **MUST** understand and be able to explain all code you submit\n- All visualizations must be publication-quality (proper titles, labels, legends)\n- Document any AI usage in the reflection section at the end\n\n**Grading:**\n- Part 1: Basic Matplotlib Charts (25 points)\n- Part 2: Customization and Styling (25 points)\n- Part 3: Seaborn Statistical Plots (25 points)\n- Part 4: Multi-Panel Figures (25 points)\n- **Total: 100 points**\n\n---"
