    "\n",
    "Before we dive into Python, let's understand the tool you're using right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Jupyter notebook is an interactive document that combines:**\n",
    "- Text and explanations (like this cell you're reading)\n",
    "- Live code that you can run and modify\n",
    "- Output from that code (numbers, graphs, tables, errors)\n",
    "- Your own notes and observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a lab notebook for data analysis. Instead of separating your code files, documentation, and results into different places, everything lives together in one document. This makes it perfect for learning Python because you see explanations, try code immediately, and can document what you discover.\n",

    "### Two Types of Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Every notebook contains two types of cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Markdown cells** (like this one): Display formatted text, headers, lists, and images. Use these for explanations and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Code cells**: Contain Python code you can execute. When you run a code cell, Python processes the commands and displays any output directly below the cell.\n",

    "\n",
    "To execute a cell:\n",
    "- Click on it to select it (you'll see a blue or green border)\n",
    "- Press **Shift + Enter** (runs the cell and moves to the next one)\n",
    "- Or press **Ctrl + Enter** (runs the cell but stays on it)\n",

    "- **Run every code cell.** Don't just read code, execute it and observe what happens.\n",
    "- **Experiment freely.** Modify code cells and run them again. Making mistakes and fixing them is how you learn.\n",

    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cell execution order matters.** Notebooks typically run from top to bottom, but you can execute cells in any sequence. This flexibility is powerful but can cause confusion. If something stops working, try restarting the notebook: **Kernel → Restart & Run All** from the menu bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Save your work.** Notebooks autosave periodically, but save manually anyway (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S). Your work is stored as a `.ipynb` file that you can share, email, or submit for assignments.\n",

Complete these **before or alongside** the exercises below to reinforce foundational concepts.\n\n### Required DataCamp Content\n\n**[Introduction to Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)** - Complete these chapters:\n\n| Chapter | Topics Covered | Alignment |\n|---------|---------------|------------|\n| Chapter 1: Python Basics | Variables, types, arithmetic operators | Sections 1.1-1.4 of this chapter |\n| Chapter 2: Python Lists | List creation, indexing, manipulation | Preview for Chapter 2 |\n\n**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours total\n\n### How to Use DataCamp\n\nDataCamp courses are interactive tutorials where you type code and get immediate feedback. This is **allowed** in CRAWL mode because:\n\n1. You're writing the code yourself (not asking AI to generate it)\n2. The exercises test your understanding with immediate correction\n3. The guided format builds muscle memory for syntax\n\n**Workflow recommendation:**\n1. Complete the DataCamp chapter first to learn the concepts interactively\n2. Return to this notebook and attempt the practice problems without looking back\n3. If stuck, re-read the relevant section in this notebook (not DataCamp)\n\n### Optional Supplementary Content\n\nIf you want additional practice beyond the required content:\n\n- **[Data Types for Data Science in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-types-for-data-science-in-python)** - Chapter 1 covers fundamental types in more depth\n- **[Python Fundamentals](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-fundamentals)** - Reinforces basics with different examples\n\n---"

    "   - Current GPA\n",
    "   - Credits attempted\n",
    "   - Credits earned\n",

    "   - Credit completion rate (as percentage)\n",
    "   - Quality points (GPA × credits earned)\n",
    "   - Approximate semesters completed (credits ÷ 15)\n",
    "   - Credits needed to graduate (assuming 120 required)\n",

    "- Add Dean's List status (GPA ≥ 3.5 with at least 12 credits)\n",
    "- Calculate what GPA is needed in remaining credits to reach 3.0 or 3.5 overall\n",
