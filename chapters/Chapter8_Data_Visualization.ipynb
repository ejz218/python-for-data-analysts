    "In Chapter 7, you learned to analyze the Lehigh student dataset with pandas. You calculated statistics, grouped data, and identified patterns. But here's a question: **if you showed your manager a table of mean GPAs by college, would they understand what it means?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably. But would they *remember* it? Would they *act* on it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is the bridge between analysis and action. A well-designed chart can:\n",

    "- Persuade decision-makers to act\n",

    "**The Reality Check:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad visualizations are everywhere. Misleading axes, cluttered legends, 3D pie charts that distort proportions. Learning to create *good* visualizations means learning what makes them effective, not just how to generate them.\n",
