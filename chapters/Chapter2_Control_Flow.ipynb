Calculate overall statistics: average GPA, total students\n2. Count students in each academic standing category\n3. Identify graduation-eligible students (credits >= 120, GPA >= 2.0)\n4. List students on academic probation with their IDs\n5. Find the highest and lowest GPA\n6. Generate a formatted report\n\n### AI Collaboration Tips\nGood prompts:\n- \"How do I iterate through a list of dictionaries in Python?\"\n- \"How can I format a table-like output in Python?\"\n\nAvoid:\n- \"Write a student analyzer for me\""
