    "This project assesses your ability to apply the complete data analysis workflow using NumPy, pandas, and visualization tools. You will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Lehigh student dataset and produce professional-quality deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "- You **MAY** use AI tools for this project (this is a RUN-level assessment)\n",
    "- You **MUST** document your AI usage in Part 6\n",
    "- You **MUST** be able to explain every line of code you submit\n",
    "- You may **NOT** collaborate with other students\n",
    "- Submit your completed notebook via CourseConnect by the deadline\n",

    "**Tips:**\n",
    "- Read each task completely before coding\n",
    "- Your visualizations should be publication-quality (titles, labels, appropriate chart types)\n",
    "- The executive summary should be written for a non-technical audience\n",
    "- If you use AI, focus on understanding the code, not just generating it\n",
