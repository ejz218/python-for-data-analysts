    "This project assesses your ability to apply Python fundamentals to a realistic data analysis task. You will work with the Lehigh student dataset to answer questions about student success patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "- You may use your notes, the textbook, and Python documentation\n",
    "- You may **NOT** use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.)\n",
    "- You may **NOT** collaborate with other students\n",
    "- Submit your completed notebook via CourseConnect by the deadline\n",
