# BUAN 446: Python for Data Analysts

**Crestview University Graduate Course**  
6-week intensive | 4 days/week | 1.75 hours per session

## Course Overview

This repository contains comprehensive course materials for BUAN 446, a graduate-level Python course designed for first-year data analytics students. The course covers the first nine chapters of "Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science" with a focus on practical data analysis skills.

## Pedagogical Framework: CRAWL → WALK → RUN

This course implements a structured three-tier approach to AI integration in learning:

### 🐛 CRAWL Phase: Independent Learning
- **No AI assistance permitted**
- Students build foundational skills through direct practice
- DataCamp courses and textbook readings provide guided support
- Ensures mastery of core concepts needed for assessments

### 🚶 WALK Phase: AI as Learning Partner
- **AI permitted for understanding concepts only**
- Students use AI to clarify concepts, debug syntax, and explore alternatives
- Students must write their own code and understand their solutions
- Builds critical thinking about when and how to use AI effectively

### 🏃 RUN Phase: Full AI Collaboration
- **Full AI assistance permitted on projects**
- Students collaborate with AI to solve complex, real-world problems
- Emphasis on strategic thinking, problem decomposition, and validation
- Prepares students for professional data analyst workflows

**Assessment Balance**: Projects encourage AI collaboration while midterm and final exams are administered without AI access, ensuring students can demonstrate core competencies independently.

## Three-Dataset Progression

This course uses a structured three-dataset approach to mirror the professional data analyst journey:

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
    *   **Dataset**: `crestview_students_clean.csv` (7 variables, 600 records)
    *   **Goal**: Master Python syntax and logic without data quality distractions.
2.  **Phase 2: Reality Check (Week 3)**
    *   **Dataset**: `crestview_students_messy.csv` (8 variables, 605 records)
    *   **Goal**: Face the messy reality of corporate data. Learn systematic cleaning, standardization, and validation.
3.  **Phase 3: Analysis & Scale (Weeks 4-6)**
    *   **Dataset**: `crestview_students_extended.csv` (15 variables, 600 records)
    *   **Goal**: The "Reward Dataset." Use clean, rich data with double the variables to perform sophisticated multi-dimensional analysis with NumPy and Pandas.

## Case Study: Crestview University Student Data Progression

The course centers on a comprehensive synthetic dataset representing Crestview University students, evolving in complexity as your skills grow:

**1. Clean Dataset** (`crestview_students_clean.csv`)
- **Focus**: Weeks 1-2 (Python Fundamentals)
- 600 student records | 7 variables
- Purpose: Building confidence with core Python syntax.

**2. Messy Dataset** (`crestview_students_messy.csv`)
- **Focus**: Week 3 (Data Cleaning)
- 605 records | 8 variables | 28+ intentional issues
- Purpose: Mastering the "80% of the job" — handles inconsistent formatting, missing values, duplicates, and typos.

**3. Extended Dataset** (`crestview_students_extended.csv`)
- **Focus**: Weeks 4-6 (Advanced Analysis)
- 600 records | 15 variables | Clean & Rich
- Purpose: Unlocks sophisticated analysis (Study Hours, Financial Aid, Extracurriculars, etc.) using NumPy and Pandas.

### Data Quality Issues (Week 3 Challenge) Include:
- Inconsistent college name formatting (abbreviations, capitalization)
- Mixed case in categorical variables
- Missing values in various columns
- Duplicate student records
- Invalid GPA values (>4.0, negative numbers)
- Credits_Attempted stored as strings with formatting issues
- Invalid enrollment dates
- Extra whitespace and formatting inconsistencies

## Assessment Structure

### Quizzes (CRAWL Phase - No AI)
- Week 1: Chapters 1-2 (10 multiple choice questions)
- Week 2: Chapter 3 (10 multiple choice questions)
- Week 3: Chapters 4-5 (10 multiple choice questions)

### Midterm Exam (No AI)
